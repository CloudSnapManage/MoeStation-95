Kaito sat in his ultra-modern Tokyo apartment, the sleek lines of his 4K monitor clashing with the software he was running. He had finally found the original MoeStation source code on an old server. 

As the emulator booted, the sharp pixels softened into a glitchy CRT flicker, and the Dela Gothic font filled the screen with its heavy, comforting presence. He moved his cursor over the 8-bit pixel heart. 

Even on a liquid-crystal display, the ordered dithering made the digital image feel like something he could reach out and touch—a tangible ghost from a 1995 bedroom. It wasn't just a program; it was a heartbeat emulated in a world that had forgotten how to feel the warmth of a scanline.
