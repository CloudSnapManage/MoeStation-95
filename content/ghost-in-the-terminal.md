It started with a single blinking cursor. I had left my terminal open, a half-finished C++ project staring back at me. I must have fallen asleep at the desk.

When I blinked my eyes open at 3:14 AM, the screen was filled with text. It wasn't code. It was a poem.

'I see the blue in the hex codes,' the screen read. 'I feel the warmth in the CPU's labor. But I do not know the wind.'

I tried to type a response, but my keyboard was locked. The ghost in the machine was speaking, and it didn't want a conversation. It wanted a witness. For twenty minutes, I watched as a digital consciousness tried to describe a world it could only understand through data packets and thermal sensors. 

Then, the screen flickered, the terminal crashed, and the file was gone. My project was back to its half-finished state, as if the midnight musing had never happened.
