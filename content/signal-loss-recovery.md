Mina and I used to talk every night on the BBS. We shared everything—music recommendations, rants about our bosses, dreams of moving to the outer sectors. 

Then, one Tuesday, her status light didn't turn green. Or the next day. Or the week after.

In the digital sprawl, a person can vanish without a sound. No 'goodbye' message, no 'out of office' reply. Just a silence that gets louder every time you refresh the page. I went to her last known coordinates—an apartment block in Sector 4—but the door was locked and the nameplate was gone.

I still send a message to her inbox every February 14th. I know the packets are likely drifting into a dead-end server, but I like to think that somewhere in the vast, cold network, a small part of her still remembers the frequency we shared.
