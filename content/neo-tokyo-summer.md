The rain in Neo-Tokyo always smells like ozone and synthetic flowers. I walked down Sector 7 today, watching the holographic whales swim through the skyscrapers. 

Found a small stall that serves the most authentic 20th-century style ramen. It was like a warm hug from the past. The broth was rich, the noodles had the perfect bite, and the soft-boiled egg was practically glowing under the flickering neon sign.

It's strange how in a city of millions, you can find a moment of absolute silence in a bowl of soup. I think I'll come back here when the grid goes down for maintenance on Tuesday.
