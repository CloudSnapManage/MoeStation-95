The air inside the Midnight Scriptorium was thick with the scent of ozone and ancient dust. It wasn't a library of books, but of magnetic tape and 3.5-inch floppy disks. 

I was looking for a specific disk—labeled 'Project Aurora' in fading blue ink. They say it contains the last uncorrupted recording of a sunrise from before the Great Haze began in '88. 

The archivist, a man whose glasses were thick enough to be magnifying loupes, pointed a gloved finger toward a row of pink plastic cases. "Memory is fragile," he whispered. "Heat, magnets, or even just time can wipe a soul clean. Be careful with that drive."

I slid the disk into my portable reader. The 'clunk-whirr' sound was the most beautiful thing I'd heard in years.
