**MoeStation 95** is a curated personal blogging platform and digital sanctuary inspired by 1990s Japanese lo-fi aesthetics, CRT-era UI, and synthwave culture. It serves as a narrative bridge between nostalgic retro-tech and modern web performance.

## 📻 The Concept
MoeStation 95 is more than a blog; it is a "Signal Receiver." It is designed to host "Synthetic Myths and Tiny Heartbreaks"—short-form fiction and visual artifacts presented through a unique, dithered interface that replicates the experience of browsing a 1995 BBS (Bulletin Board System).

### Key Features
- **Narrative Archives**: Markdown-powered storytelling with a "Heart-Drive" floppy disk aesthetic.
- **Radio Room**: High-fidelity atmospheric streaming with a contributor credit system.
- **Visual Gallery**: A pinned-board style collection for poetry and sketches.
- **Dynamic Theming**: Four distinct modes (Classic, Midnight, Terminal, Vaporwave) for varying signal conditions.
- **Contributor Hub**: A specialized workflow for music recommendations, bug reporting, and author verification.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React 19 (ESM)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router 7 (Hash-based for high compatibility)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Typography**: Dela Gothic One, Outfit, Space Mono, Cormorant Garamond
